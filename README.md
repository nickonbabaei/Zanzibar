### ***Description***
#### Welcome to my creation of Zanzibar, a fun dice game suitable for all. A two player game, starting with 5 chips each. The goal of the game is to get rid of all your chips. The player who gets rid of all 5 chips first wins. In order to do so, one player at a tie, must roll 3 dice simultaneously. The player with the highest scoring dice combination gives away a number of their chips to the other player. This continues until one player is left with 0 chips and wins. Enjoy!

##### The project itself was deployed and can be viewed [here](https://zanzibar-project.surge.sh).
